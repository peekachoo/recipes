    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am obsessed with this recipe. I've been making cookies almost every week ever since I've done it the first time. And sometimes I can't sleep at night because I have a cookie craving...</p>

        <li>100gr melted butter.</li>

        <li>1tsp of vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>1 whole egg.</li>
        <li>1tsp of baking soda.</li>
        <li>1tsp of salt.</li>
        <li>180gr of AP flour.</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>
