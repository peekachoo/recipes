    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I've made this 3 times. The first and second I didn't really like it. But the third time it turned out super chewy and delicious and I liked it very much. But the reason why I don't make it much is because it's more labor-demanding than making cookies (yes it is!).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>AP flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar (seriously don't use big grained sugar the texture would suck!)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150*C. Bake the flour for 5 minutes. Stir up mid-way.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, prepare the wet ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix up melted butter, sugar and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Combine the wet ingredients with flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Add milk to adjust the texture until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Add in chocolate chips and continue to mix.</li>
        <li>(Mandatory!) (Preshape if wanted) Cover carefully and let chill in the fridge for at least 1 day.</li>
        <li>Enjoy with ice scream or a cup of milk :).</li>
    </ol>
